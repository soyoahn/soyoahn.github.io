## <font color="#0FB493">Case Study: Making Production Decisions Based On User Testing</font>
🎮🧪 I was asked to work with decision makers to pick our next map for postlaunch production, based on user testing feedback. 

- **Problem**: Decision makers informed me that the data wasn't useful because you couldn't tell who was giving feedback (thus missing important context about the corresponding tester's playstyle and experience level), and instead, you'd see the feedback grouped together, like: "too big" "just right" "snipers" "close combat"--all in one anonymized block. 
- So I asked Research for the raw data. The raw data helped with each participant's data, but it still only gave the list of maps tested per day, with no information about the order in which the maps were tested. Thus, user feedback like "I liked the first one better," was completely unusable. To re-represent the data, I asked for a key (the test plan) to get information about which participants played which maps, in which order, on which days. 
- I then used some Excel magic to lay out all the feedback comments per participant, with full context of which maps they were actually talking about. (I gave this information and feedback to user testing so that they could improve their reports going forward if they wanted to.) 
- The Excel magic took just one afternoon. The impact was that I redcued at least two days of user testing data from the trash.
- I felt proud for improving a long-existing problem that wasn't even clearly identified as a problem before I dove in with that classic technical writer curiosity and desire to deliver meaningful information to drive happy and confident decisions. <br><br>It's difficult trying to figure out how to provide a visual for this without revealing anything about the testing methods, so please bear with me: <br><br>**A snippet of the original report:**<br>![This is an image of the original data--impossible to know which map they are talking about because the map order per day wasn't presented in the original report.](/img/posts/2025/user-data-case-study-original.png)<br>*It wasn't possible to know which map was first or second without additional information that wasn't provided in the original report.* <br><br>**A snippet of my version of the report:**  <br>![This is an image of my version of the data--I've given more readable columns and made it clear which map was first and second on days 1 and 2 of testing per participant.](/img/posts/2025/user-data-case-study-mine.png)<br>*I wish I could share more of my spreadsheet here because it's freaking beautiful.*
