## <font color="#0FB493">Case Study: Making Production Decisions Based On User Testing</font>
I was asked to work with decision makers to pick our next map for postlaunch production, based on user testing feedback. 

- Decision makers informed me that the data wasn't useful because you couldn't tell who was giving feedback (thus missing important context about the corresponding tester's playstyle and experience level), and instead, you'd see the feedback grouped together, like: "too big" "just right" "snipers" "close combat"--all in one anonymized block. So I asked Research for the raw data. 
- The raw data helped with each participant's data, but it still only gave the list of maps tested per day, but no information about which order the maps were tested, which made comments like "I liked the first one better," completely unusable. To re-represent the data, I asked for a key (the test plan) to get information about which participants played which maps, in which order, on which days. 
- I then used some Excel magic to lay out all the feedback comments per participant, with full context of which maps they were actually talking about. (I gave this information and feedback to user testing so that they could improve their reports going forward if they wanted to.) 
- I felt proud for improving a long-existing problem that wasn't even clearly identified as a problem before I dove in with that classic technical writer curiosity and desire to deliver meaningful information to drive happy and confident decisions. <br><br>It's difficult trying to figure out how to provide a visual for this without revealing anything about the testing methods, so please bear with me: <br><br>**A snippet of the original report:**<br>![This is an image of the original data--impossible to know which map they are talking about because the map order per day wasn't presented in the original report.](/img/posts/2025/user-data-case-study-original.png)<br>*It wasn't possible to know which map was first or second without additional information that wasn't provided in the original report.* <br><br>**A snippet of my version of the report:**  <br>![This is an image of my version of the data--I've given more readable columns and made it clear which map was first and second on days 1 and 2 of testing per participant.](/img/posts/2025/user-data-case-study-mine.png)<br>*I wish I could share more of my spreadsheet here because it's freaking beautiful.*

## <font color="#0FB493">Case Study: Build Executables</font>
When you build your levels locally, there's an option for the type of executable you wanted to run as well (Test, Demo, Ship, etc). 
- Because a value for this field was selected by default at build time (it might have been multi-select, but I can't remember), many devs assumed (naturally so) that they were also selecting the type of executable they wanted to build, and thought they were *only* building that executable.  
- I noticed that when I was at devs' desks, they would close their game and **rebuild** the map just to run a different executable. Hearing that this was a pain, I investigated why we don't build all the executables at build time (in other words, the tradeoffs for how long it would take to build them all every time, versus how much it costs devs to have to rebuild each time they wanted to build a different one). 
- Then I learned that they were **all** already being built at build time! I can't remember if I discovered this on my own by checking the timestamp on those executables on my local machine, of if I asked an engineer. 
- Upon realizing this, I was able to update all the documentation and do deskside evangelization in the kindest and most discreet way possible (some devs had not realized this for years and I didn't want them to grieve those hours wasted over the years too badly). 
- In retrospect, I wish I'd also asked the tools engineer to change the inline help text to something like: *Build generates all game exes. Select the default one to launch when the build's done:* ... or something like that. 

This type of discovery is why I love watching users work in real time, and why I'll always ask for opportunities to do this type of shadowing and build real relationships with the people I'm supposed to be serving.
