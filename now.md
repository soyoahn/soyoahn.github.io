# What's Now

So tired.

## Work
- Lots of ups and downs.

## Personal
- Limits to Growth (The 30 Year Update) - Donella Meadows et al 
- Paused reading 🩻 Harrow the Ninth (#2 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir -- saving for the holidays
- Paused reading Parable of the Talents (#2 Earthseed) by Octavia Butler -- saving for when I have more capacity for depression
- Still in L.A. 
- Trying to do fulfilling personal projects--trying to gain some kind of identity outside of work
- <s>Learning some American Sign Language with the Lingvano app</s>

## Social Things I'm Doing
- [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) with a friend's group of friends, round 3
- Book club at work
- <s>Korean speaking practice group at work</s>
- <s>School's back, so lots of time with other parents and our littles</s>
- Going into the office more--nice to see people and get some audiobook time.

## This Site
- Haven't yet customized the template CSS. I especially want to: (1) Change the heading styles (2) Add a floating generated TOC for the desktop version (3) Possibly change the main font. 

## What's On My Mind Lately
- Enclosure of the human right to use one's brain. 
- Mental illness in the world. 
- Rampant unemployment among my excellent former colleagues.
- Too much screen time.
- People's impatience with others--on the road, in the office, at the store, everywhere. Impatient people ready to be angry.

What's a **now** page?: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
