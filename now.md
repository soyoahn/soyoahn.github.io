# What's Now

## Work
- Still at Riot Games and confronting some unique-to-me challenges there. (Some of it's me, some of it's the org.  Trying to make it fit.)
- I had the great luck of moving back into technical writing (from marketing-adjacent writing), but with a whole lot less autonomy and less freedom to "just try things" than I've been used to my whole 17-year career.

## Personal
- Reading ðŸ©» Harrow the Ninth (#2 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir and ðŸ˜° Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler 
- Still in L.A. 
- Trying to do fulfilling personal projects--trying to gain some kind of identity outside of work

## Social Things I'm Doing
- [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) with a friend's group of friends
- Book club at work
- Someone at work started a social club for local folks--I joined it but haven't attended events yet

## This Site
- I still haven't customized the CSS from the template yet. I especially want to: (1) Change the heading styles (2) Add a floating generated TOC for the desktop version (3) Possibly change the main font. 

## Heavy Things 
// I might omit this section in the future but for now no one's reading this so why not)   
- It's hard to watch the world burn and see wasted human potential everywhere. (Especially worried about the younger generation.) People with incredible talent and potential shouldn't be permanently rejected by society just because they learned how to play the game too late. 
- I think I need to be a producer again. That level of impact and constant problem solving is hard to forget and give up. I crave chewing on those problems daily.

What's a **now** page? So glad you asked: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
