# What's Now

## Work
- Still at Riot Games and confronting some unique-to-me challenges there. (Some of it's me, some of it's the org.)
- I had the great luck of moving back into technical writing, but with a whole lot less autonomy and less freedom to "just try things" than I'm used to.

## Personal
- Reading Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir
- Still in L.A., family life is still wonderful and I'm grateful for that. 
- I'm thinking about getting back into jewelry-making--something I loved in high school. Soldering kits + pliers are about $150 all-in so why not? Early birthday present for myself, maybe. 

## Social Things I'm Doing
- [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) with a friend's group of friends
- Book club at work
- Someone at work started a social club for local folks--I joined it but haven't attended events yet

## This Site
- I still haven't customized the CSS from the template yet. I especially want to: (1) Change the heading styles (2) Add a floating generated TOC for the desktop versio (3) Possibly change the main font. 

## Heavy Things 
// I might omit this section in the future but for now no one's reading this so why not)   
- It's hard to watch the world burn and see wasted human potential everywhere. (Especially thinking about the younger generation lacking motivation and the types of training and mentorship like I had.) People with incredible talent and potential shouldn't be permanently rejected by society just because they learned how to play the game too late. 
- I think I need to be a producer again. That level of impact and constant problem solving (out of true, intrinsic necessity!) is hard to forget and give up. I crave chewing on those problems daily.

What's a **now** page? So glad you asked: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
