# What's Now

## Work
- Trying to stay focused and not getting distracted by wanting to work the way I prefer to work.
- Trying to figure out my next career move. I'm not happy with the way things are, and I'm not sure what kind of training I need to move towards the next thing (whatever the next thing is). 

## Personal
- Reading Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir
- Still in L.A., family life is still wonderful and I'm grateful for that. 
- I'm thinking about getting back into jewelry-making--something I loved in high school. Soldering kits + pliers are about $150 all-in so why not? Early birthday present for myself, maybe. 

## Social Things I'm Doing
- [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) 
-  Book club at work

## TMI/Depressing Stuff Happening Now (A section I might omit in the future but for now no one's reading this so why the heck not)   
- Having a slight existential crisis. It's hard to watch the world burn and see wasted human potential everywhere.
- I crave time with kindred spirits but I crave time alone more.
- For the first time in my life, I don't know what's next and I'm crazed with the fear of uncertainty. 
- I feel like I'm supposed to be doing something else but it's very hard to continue believing in myself. I don't know how to break out of this yet. 


What's a **now** page? So glad you asked: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
