# What's Now

## Work
- I've had full autonomy for most of my career. In my latest career move, I don't have it and it's destroying my mental state. **I'm still not sure how much I'm supposed to adapt.** (This company was supposed to be the land of milk and honey, where "rare, responsible people"--I'm borrowing Netflix's term, but the company is not Netflix--would have enough autonomy to experiment and try big things. But unfortunately I joined right when the company decided to do a massive u-turn and is in the process of overcorrecting itself in various ways.) 
- I'll admit it: I made a huge mistake by succumbing to the sweeping "me" mentality of The Great Resignation.
- I've been scouring various slack and discord communities to figure out whether "things" have shifted permanently (and how much I need to change... everything about myself), or if there are pockets of corporate America where ICs can still make a difference without playing the performative corporate game. I guess that's what everyone wants to know--how much of the current state is a passing fad and how much time and energy to invest in adapting. Are there any more writing & design-adjacent jobs where one spends most of their time doing **real work**. (Rather than talking about doing work, making guesses about whether the work will be worth it, and then months later deciding to do or abort the work. Why are we doing so much of this lately?)
- Why am I so unwilling to spend time doing bullshit tasks? Is it ego? (It might be--I really don't know.) If someone recognizes this as a naive version of their former selves and you have insight, please share. I actually don't know. 

## Personal
- Reading Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir
- Still in L.A., family life is still wonderful and I'm grateful for that. 
- I'm thinking about getting back into jewelry-making--something I loved in high school. Soldering kits + pliers are about $150 all-in so why not? Early birthday present for myself, maybe. 

## TMI/Depressing Stuff Happening Now (A section I might omit in the future but for now no one's reading this so why the heck not)   
- Having a slight existential crisis. It's hard to watch the world burn and see wasted human potential everywhere.
- I crave time with kindred spirits but I crave time alone more.
- For the first time in my life, I don't know what's next and I'm crazed with the fear of uncertainty. 
- I feel like I'm supposed to be doing else but it's very hard to continue believing in myself. I don't know how to break out of this yet. 


What's a now page? So glad you asked: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
