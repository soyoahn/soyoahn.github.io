# What's Now

## Week of 10/20/2025
- One of my busiest weeks of recent memory: field trip, trunk-or-treat car decor, making two Halloween costumes, making painted shell thingies to give away for trunk-or-treat, performance self-evals are due, and tons of work deadlines. 

## Work
- Ups mostly!

## Personal
- Reading Legacy of OrÃ¯sha series by Tomi Adeyemi
- Reading Barefoot Gen by Keiji Nakazawa
- Reading ðŸ©» Harrow the Ninth (#2 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir 
- Paused reading Parable of the Talents (#2 Earthseed) by Octavia Butler 
- Still in L.A. 
- Trying to do fulfilling personal projects--trying to gain some kind of identity outside of work
- Learning some American Sign Language with the Lingvano app

## Social Things I'm Doing
- [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) with a friend's group of friends, round 2
- Book club at work
- Korean speaking practice group at work
- School's back, so lots of time with other parents and our littles
- Going into the office more--nice to see people and get some audiobook time.

## This Site
- Haven't yet customized the template CSS. I especially want to: (1) Change the heading styles (2) Add a floating generated TOC for the desktop version (3) Possibly change the main font. 

## Heavy Things 
// I might omit this section in the future but for now no one's reading this so why not)   
- It's hard to watch the world burn and see wasted human potential everywhere. (Especially worried about the younger generation.) People with incredible talent and potential shouldn't be permanently rejected by society just because they learned how to play the game too late. 
- Are people getting lazier, more impatient, meaner, and more dishonest? Is it because we are profoundly more bored than ever before? Most are paid far below a living wage to squander all their time on unfulfilling work. Wtf are we doing, as a society?
