What's Now: 

- Reading Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir
- Having a slight existential crisis. It's hard watching the world burn and seeing wasted human potential everywhere. 
- For the first time in my life, I don't know what's next. 
- Getting ready for the company hackathon next week. 
- Still in L.A., family life is still wonderful and I'm grateful for that. 
- I'm thinking about getting back into jewelry-making--something I loved in high school. Soldering kits + pliers are about $150 all-in so why not? Early birthday present for myself, maybe. 

What's a now page? So glad you asked: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
