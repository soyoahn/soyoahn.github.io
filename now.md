# What's Now

## Work
- Ups and downs

## Personal
- Commute audiobook: Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter Miller
- Reading ðŸ©» Harrow the Ninth (#2 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir 
- Paused reading Parable of the Talents (#2 Earthseed) by Octavia Butler 
- Still in L.A. 
- Trying to do fulfilling personal projects--trying to gain some kind of identity outside of work
- Learning some American Sign Language with the Lingvano app

## Social Things I'm Doing
- [Music League](https://musicleague.com/) with a friend's group of friends, round 2
- Book club at work
- Korean speaking practice group at work

## This Site
- Haven't yet customized the template CSS. I especially want to: (1) Change the heading styles (2) Add a floating generated TOC for the desktop version (3) Possibly change the main font. 

## Heavy Things 
// I might omit this section in the future but for now no one's reading this so why not)   
- It's hard to watch the world burn and see wasted human potential everywhere. (Especially worried about the younger generation.) People with incredible talent and potential shouldn't be permanently rejected by society just because they learned how to play the game too late.

What's a **now** page? So glad you asked: [https://nownownow.com/](https://nownownow.com/). <br>I love this--it feels like the first entry in a Dungeon Anarchist Cookbook.
