What's Now: 

- Reading Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir
- Having a slight existential crisis. It's hard watching the world burn and seeing wasted human potential everywhere. 
- For the first time in my life, I don't know what's next. 
- Getting ready for the company hackathon next week. 
- Still in L.A., family life is still wonderful and I'm grateful for that.
