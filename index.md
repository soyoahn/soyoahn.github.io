**Technical Writer Working in Games**

Alright! Blog! Time to try this medium again.
This [site](_posts/2025-06-21-about-this-blog.html) isn't meant for any one use case (personal, professional, "mommy blogging"). It's just a centralized place to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. :)

I'm a technical writer and the mom of two toddlers. We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (19 now... I'd love to 3x this number in the next year or so). 


**How I Work**

I've had brief, lucky stints as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. These opportunities spontaneously appeared out of my regular technical writing job. 

My formula: I care and I'm curious. If I think I understand something, I try to imagine my understanding from yet another user role/viewpoint and see if I have a complete picture. 


**Professional Passion: User Experience and Optimal Workflows Above All**

I'm most passionate about creating systems of information that support complete workflows--it's my greatest peeve when I've left critical knowledge gaps in any single workflow.

I think it's a misuse of time to design an architecture and infrastructure before fully addressing at least 2 to 3 customers' most dire information needs reasonably well. Instead, I recommend solving a few specific problems first, then designing the system based on your findings and understanding of your specific users. 

Start simple by creating something useful, earning trust, and then doing the bigger things. Once you've done that for a few months, you can build the whole system to slot more things into!
