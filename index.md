Time to start blogging, I guess! 
This site isn't meant for any one person. It's a centralized place to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. :) 

I'm a technical writer and the mom of two toddlers. We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (19 now... I'd love to 3x this number in the next year or so). 

I've had brief, lucky stints as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. 

Writing-wise, I'm most passionate about creating systems of information that completely support single workflows at a time. I should expound in a blog entry sometime, but the gist is: I think that extensively planning or _overplanning_ an architecture and doc infrastructure before you've fully addressed at least THREE customers' most dire information needs reasonably well, is a fool's game.
