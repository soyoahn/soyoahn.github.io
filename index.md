**Technical Writer + Knowledge Manager + Game Producer**

I could really use the outlet, so here I go blogging again. 

This [space](2025/06/21/about-this-blog.html) will be a personal and professional catch-all to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. 

*Beware of Style Discrepancies:* Some blog entries will be Sentence case and others will be Title Case and I'm not going to worry about it here. 🕊️

**About Me**

I'm a technical writer based in Los Angeles and the mom of two toddlers. My husband's a [narrative writer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chazp). We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (<s>19</s> [26](2025/07/05/what-i-did-during-mid-year-break.html#plants) now). 

I don't (and won't) use generative AI for writing, art, and ideation. I'd rather phone a friend. I *have* used it to do simple tasks like transform html to markdown and will sometimes use it to help me process large amounts of literal rows of data.

**Career Highlights**

In recent years, I've polymorphed into roles as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. These opportunities sprang out of my regular technical writing job. 

I love learning the deep innards of a system--the design rationales, tech constraints, policy origin stories--using all of the context to inform my work. 

In every new knowledge area, I attempt to solve a few specific problems well first, which is the quickest path to meaningfully gaining a sense of what's important to my <font color="#F21B1B">specific users</font>. By learning about my users + creators and what is or isn't important, I can strive to design information that's tailored to needs. The hardest part is learning what is or isn't important--and this is why gaining **firsthand expertise steeped in realistic context is critical to my process**.
