**Technical Writer Working in Games**

Alright! Blog! Time to try this medium again.
This [site](2025/06/21/about-this-blog.html) isn't meant for any one use case (personal, professional, "mommy blogging"). It's just a centralized place to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. :)

I'm a technical writer and the mom of two toddlers. We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (19 now... I'd love to 3x this number in the next year or so). 


**Sometimes Not a Technical Writer**

I've had brief, lucky stints as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. These opportunities spontaneously appeared out of my regular technical writing job. 

_Why'd that happen?_ Not sure, but I do know that **I care and I'm curious**. I love anticipating needs and solving problems (trite but true). When I think I understand something, I consider the words from yet another use case/user role/tangential workflow until I have a clear enough picture of the system. I'm pretty sure that that type of internal motivation is what landed me all the cool opportunities in my life. 


**Professional Passion: User Experience and Optimal Workflows Above All**

I'm most passionate about creating systems of information that support complete workflows--it's my greatest peeve when I've left critical knowledge gaps in any single workflow.

Having made the mistake myself, many times: I think it's futile to design an architecture and infrastructure before fully addressing at least 2 to 3 customers' most dire information needs reasonably well. Instead, I recommend solving a few specific problems first, then designing the system based on your findings and understanding of your <font color="#F21B1B">specific users</font>. 

Start simple by creating something useful, earning trust, and then doing the bigger things. Once you've done that for a few months, you can build the whole system to slot more things into!
