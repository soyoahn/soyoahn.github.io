**Technical Writer + Knowledge Manager + Game Producer**

I could really use the outlet, so here I go blogging again. 

This [space](2025/06/21/about-this-blog.html) will be a personal and professional catch-all to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. :)

**About Me**

I'm a technical writer based in Los Angeles and the mom of two toddlers. We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (<s>19</s> [26](2025/07/05/what-i-did-during-mid-year-break.html#plants) now... I'd love to 2x this number in the next year or so). 


**Sometimes a Technical Writer++**

I've had brief stints as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. These opportunities spontaneously appeared out of my regular technical writing job. 

I love learning the deep innards of a system--the design rationales, tech constraints, policy origin stories--and anticipating needs and solving problems (trite but true). 

I always prefer solving a few specific problems first, then designing the system based on understanding what's important to my <font color="#F21B1B">specific users</font>. By learning about my users + creators and what is or isn't important, I gain an informed idea to design information that fits the needs of all users in the system. The hardest part is learning what is or isn't important--and this is why **gaining firsthand expertise is critical to my process**.
