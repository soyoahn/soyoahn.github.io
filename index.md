**Technical Writer Working in Games**

Time to start blogging, I guess! 
This site isn't meant for any one use case (personal, professional, "mommy blogging"). It's just a centralized place to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. :)

I'm a technical writer and the mom of two toddlers. We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (19 now... I'd love to 3x this number in the next year or so). 

I've had brief, lucky stints as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. 

Writing-wise, I'm most passionate about creating systems of information that support complete workflows. I should expound in a blog entry sometime, but the gist is: I think that extensively planning or _overplanning_ an architecture and doc infrastructure before you've fully addressed at least 2 to 3 customers' most dire information needs reasonably well, is a fool's game. Solve a few specific problems first, then design the system based on your findings. Sounds simple, right? I find that it's best to start simple by creating something useful, EARN trust, and then do the bigger things.   

This blog was built with this generous bootstrap: [@chadbaldwin's Building a Free Blog with GitHub Pages in Minutes](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). Someday I'll sit down and update the styles to make it my own...
