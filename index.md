**Technical Writer + Knowledge Manager + Game Producer**

I could really use the outlet, so here I go blogging again. 

This [space](2025/06/21/about-this-blog.html) will be a personal and professional catch-all to keep notes that I can easily share with a link. :)

**About Me**

I'm a technical writer based in Los Angeles and the mom of two toddlers. We have one brown tabby cat and a growing collection of houseplants (<s>19</s> [26](2025/07/05/what-i-did-during-mid-year-break.html#plants) now... I'd love to 2x this number in the next year or so). 


**Sometimes a Technical Writer++**

I've had brief stints as a business analyst, game content producer, and technical producer. These opportunities spontaneously appeared out of my regular technical writing job. 

_Why'd that happen?_ Mostly luck and great managers. Also, **I care (a lot, about everything) and I'm curious**. I love anticipating needs and solving problems (trite but true). When I think I understand something, I consider the words from yet another use case/user role/tangential workflow and repeat until I have a clear enough picture of the system. I'm pretty sure that this internal motivation is what landed me all the cool opportunities in my life. 


**Professional Passion: Helping People and Achieving Optimal, Error-Preventative Workflows**

I'm most passionate about creating systems of information that support complete workflows--factoring the entire lifecycle of the topic or process.

I think it's futile to design an architecture and infrastructure before first addressing at least 2 to 3 customers' most dire information needs reasonably well. I always prefer solving a few specific problems first, then designing the system based on your findings and understanding of your <font color="#F21B1B">specific users</font>. By doing this, you'll learn critical things about your users, your devs (and doc contributers), and get a better idea of which documentation designs and processes simply won't work for your org. 

Start simple by creating something useful, earning trust, and then doing the bigger things. Once you've done that for a few months, you can build the whole system to slot more things into!
