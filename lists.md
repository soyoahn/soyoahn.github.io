## <font color="#038C73">Books Read</font>
2025
- **The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka** <font color="gray">{ This was required reading in high school but I didn't understand it then. Is it possible to understand it without having lived an enough number of years and without having witnessed a fair share of personal tragedies? Is Gregor's story a common one these days? I know a Gregor and I don't know what the solution is. Certainly not the one in the book. }</font>
- **The Stranger by Albert Camus** <font color="gray">{ Dreadful. What did I just read? Like King Lear's Cordelia--Meursault fails to care to realize that we live in a society. A cautionary tale for an increasing number of people in this terribly alienating mask of a society we live in now. }</font>
- **Animal Farm by George Orwell** (re-read) <font color="gray">{ Everyone should revisit this book. }</font>
- **Parable of the Sower (#1 Earthseed) by Octavia Butler** <font color="gray">{ Loved Lauren. I fear the book. Too prophetic. }</font>
- **Gideon the Ninth (#1 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir** <font color="gray">{ So funny. Absolutely loved it! Almost gave up, but it gets good 60% in. }</font>
- **User Friendly: How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way We Live, Work, and Play by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant** <font color="gray">{ A must-read for everyone living in the world today to become “informed, critical consumers of design.” }</font>
- **Dawn by Octavia Butler** <font color="gray">{ It wasn't for me }</font>
- **Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin** <font color="gray">{ Finally read this. Not sure how I feel about it. Great writing, but I don't like that this type of storytelling became a trend. Darcy isn't "perfect" he's unrealistic to a boring degree. }</font>
- **Talking As Fast As I Can (via audiobook read by Lauren Graham)** <font color="gray">{ Surprisingly resonant chapter about concern for a distraction-addicted world. I didn't think I'd like this but this book made me a huge fan of Lauren Graham. }</font>
- **The Third Gilmore Girl (via audiobook read by Kelly Bishop)** <font color="gray">{ I'm currently a sucker for these show business-related commute reads }</font>
- **This Inevitable Ruin (Dungeon Crawler Carl #7) by Matt Dinneman (via audiobook narrated by Jeff Hays)** <font color="gray">{ Lots of things had to happen to get here and it didn't disappoint. }</font>
- **The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien** <font color="gray">{ Finally read this. } </font>

2024
- **Mort by Terry Pratchett** <font color="gray">{ It has its moments, but generally whatever. }</font>
- **Dungeon Crawler Carl (#1-6) by Matt Dinneman (via audiobook narrated by Jeff Hays)** <font color="gray">{ As the kids say: I'm completely obsessed. }</font>
- **The Ballad of Black Tom by Victor Lavalle** <font color="gray">{ I didn't enjoy it }</font>
- **A Prayer for the Crown-Shy by Becky Chambers** <font color="gray">{ I didn't enjoy it }</font>
- **A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers** <font color="gray">{ Love the setting and the wandering tea monk thing, but didn't see much story to sink into? }</font>
- **On Writing by Stephen King** <font color="gray">{ OK I get it now }</font>
- **Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree** <font color="gray">{ Cozy }</font>
- **Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin** <font color="gray">{ Ugly cried a couple times and related to Marx's production style a lot }</font>
- **Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry by Jason Schreier** <font color="gray">{ Interesting }</font>
- **The Woman in Me by Britney Spears** <font color="gray">{ As a child of the late 90s-00s, how could I not read this? }</font>
- **My Name Is Barbra (via audiobook narrated by Barbra Streisand)** <font color="gray">{ McConnell's Coffee Ice Cream, huh. This was great though actually. }</font>
