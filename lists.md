2025
- Parable of the Sower (#1 Earthseed) by Octavia Butler <font color="#FFB5C0">{Loved it, but depressing world too much like our own}</font>
- Gideon the Ninth (#1 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir <font color="#FFB5C0">{Absolutely loved it! Almost gave up, but it gets good 60% in.}</font>

- Dawn by Octavia Butler <font color="#FFB5C0">{It wasn't for me}</font>
- Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin <font color="#FFB5C0">{Finally read this. Not sure how I feel about it. Great writing, but I don't like that this type of storytelling became a trend. Darcy isn't "perfect" he's unrealistic to a boring degree.}</font>
