## <font color="#038C73">Books Read</font>
2026
- **The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien** <font color="gray">{ <strong>*spoilers*</strong> Loved LotR so much... didn't enjoy this, but probably would have in grade school. Really disliked Thorin (but luckily we have Balin to make up for it), Smaug died so abruptly, didn't like Gandalf in this one, and there were some bizarre plot points (hated the Arkenstone stuff). My favorite part was when Beorn followed the group to Mirkwood for his ponies--that seemed very realistic and I love that he was very no-half-measures about it. Why couldn't Gandalf just articulate why he was able to keep his borrowed horse and intentionally leave everyone in the dark? He could have just said that Beorn made an exception for him. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Frustrating. }</font>

2025
- **Against the Machine by Paul Kingsnorth** <font color="gray">{ he should have leaned on the environmental stuff he knows best. he brought up a lot of other things that weakened his argument and alienates a lot of potential would-be supporters. appreciated the thorough explanation and illustration of enclosure. }</font>
- **The Last House on Needless Street by Catriona Ward** <font color="gray">{ book club read, utter pageturner }</font>
- **Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame** <font color="gray">{ okay I understand Mr. Toad's Wild Ride now }</font>
- **Master Man by Leo Tolstoy** <font color="gray">(short story)</font>
- **The Death of Ivan Ilyich by Leo Tolstoy** <font color="gray">(novella)</font>
- **Ubik by Philip K. Dick** <font color="gray">{ re-read... still kind of confusing and not sure whether any of it makes sense. }</font>
- **Barefoot Gen (#1) by Keiji Nakazawa** <font color="gray">{ a harrowing comic book written by an artist-survivor of Hiroshima }</font>
- **Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck** <font color="gray">{ what perfect writing. this one was harrowing too. }</font>
- **A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller Jr.** <font color="gray">{ more impactful when you learn the author's bio }</font>
- **The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka** <font color="gray">{ This was required reading in high school but I didn't understand it then. Is it possible to understand it without having lived enough number of years and without having witnessed a fair share of personal tragedies? }</font>
- **The Stranger by Albert Camus** <font color="gray">{ Dreadful. What did I just read? Like King Lear's Cordelia--Meursault cannot realize that he lives in a society. A cautionary tale for an increasing number of people in this terribly alienating mask of a society we live in now. }</font>
- **Animal Farm by George Orwell** (re-read) <font color="gray">{ Everyone should revisit this book. }</font>
- **Parable of the Sower (#1 Earthseed) by Octavia Butler** <font color="gray">{ Loved Lauren.This book gives me nightmares. Too prophetic. }</font>
- **Gideon the Ninth (#1 The Locked Tomb) by Tamsyn Muir** <font color="gray">{ Book club read. So funny. Absolutely loved it! Almost gave up, but it gets good ~60% in. }</font>
- **User Friendly: How the Hidden Rules of Design Are Changing the Way We Live, Work, and Play by Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricant** <font color="gray">{ A must-read for everyone living in the world today to become “informed, critical consumers of design.” }</font>
- **Dawn by Octavia Butler** <font color="gray">{ Book club read. It wasn't for me }</font>
- **Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin** <font color="gray">{ The most appealing thing about Darcy and Elizabeth is their desire for true companionship in one another--of whom they can endlessly learn and grow with. They complete each other and mutually broaden the other's perspectives and horizons (the movies tend to only show Lizzie bettering Darcy, but the book makes clear that Lizzie's super excited about the knowledge and thinking Darcy can share with her). Everyone should strive for this type of happiness. }</font>
- **Talking As Fast As I Can (via audiobook read by Lauren Graham)** <font color="gray">{ Surprisingly resonant chapter about concern for a distraction-addicted world. I didn't think I'd like this but this book made me a huge fan of Lauren Graham. }</font>
- **The Third Gilmore Girl (via audiobook read by Kelly Bishop)** <font color="gray">{ I'm currently a sucker for these show business-related commute reads }</font>
- **This Inevitable Ruin (Dungeon Crawler Carl #7) by Matt Dinneman (via audiobook narrated by Jeff Hays)** <font color="gray">{ Lots of things had to happen to get here and it didn't disappoint. }</font>
- **The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien** <font color="gray">{ Finally read this. } </font>

2024
- **Mort by Terry Pratchett** <font color="gray">{ It has its moments, but generally whatever. }</font>
- **Dungeon Crawler Carl (#1-6) by Matt Dinneman (via audiobook narrated by Jeff Hays)** <font color="gray">{ As the kids say: I'm completely obsessed. }</font>
- **The Ballad of Black Tom by Victor Lavalle** <font color="gray">{ Book club read. I didn't enjoy it }</font>
- **A Prayer for the Crown-Shy by Becky Chambers** <font color="gray">{ I didn't enjoy it }</font>
- **A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers** <font color="gray">{ Book club read. Love the setting and the wandering tea monk thing, but didn't see much story to sink into? }</font>
- **On Writing by Stephen King** <font color="gray">{ OK I get it now }</font>
- **Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree** <font color="gray">{ Book club read. Cozy. }</font>
- **Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin** <font color="gray">{ Book club read. Ugly cried a couple times and related to Marx's production style a lot }</font>
- **Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry by Jason Schreier** <font color="gray">{ Interesting }</font>
- **The Woman in Me by Britney Spears** <font color="gray">{ As a child of the late 90s-00s, how could I not read this? }</font>
- **My Name Is Barbra (via audiobook narrated by Barbra Streisand)** <font color="gray">{ McConnell's Coffee Ice Cream, huh. This was great though actually. }</font>
