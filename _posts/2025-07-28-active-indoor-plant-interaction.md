# Scientific Study: Interaction with Indoor Plants vs a Computer Task
---

Misting my zebra fern is a very calming experience. I wondered if any studies had been done on the psychological effects of plant care and found this study among the top results: 

**Study**: [Interaction with indoor plants may reduce psychological and physiological stress by suppressing autonomic nervous system activity in young adults: a randomized crossover study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4419447/)

**Critique**: They compared a word processing (computer) task with the plant transplanting task, arguing that the computer task "needs continuous physical activity, like the \[plant\] transplanting task." 

Instead, I wish their control group was some other hands-on activity (like making balls out of play dough) so that the plant aspect was significant to the results--and not just the circustance of being away from a computer, doing something with one's hands.
