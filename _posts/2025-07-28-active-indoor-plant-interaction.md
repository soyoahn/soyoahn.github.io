# Scientific Study: Interaction with Indoor Plants 🪴 vs a Computer Task 🖥️
---

> Misting my zebra fern is a very calming experience. I wondered if any studies had been done on the psychological effects of plant care and found this study among the top results: 

**Study**: [Interaction with indoor plants may reduce psychological and physiological stress by suppressing autonomic nervous system activity in young adults: a randomized crossover study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4419447/)

**Summary (one sentence)**: The study compared a word processing task (control group) with the plant transplanting task (experimental group), arguing that the computer task "needs continuous physical activity, like the \[plant\] transplanting task." 

**Critique (one sentence)**: Upon first read, I wish their control group was some other hands-on activity, such as making balls out of play dough (so it's active work with the hands but not much more than that) so that the plant aspect would be more meaningful to the results.
