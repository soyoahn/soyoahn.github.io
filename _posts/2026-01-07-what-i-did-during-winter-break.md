# What I did during the company Winter Break

Every year, the company I work for takes off the last two weeks of the year. I took off an extra week early because I forgot to take PTO earlier in the year! 

Lots of plans, lots of plans.

**Here's what I did:**

* Kid #1 got sick with norovirus and projectiled *AS* we were walking out the door to the big company holiday party. (We did not make it to the party.)
* When Kid #1 was all better, Kid #2 got really sick for 10 days.
* Just when Kid #2 was all better, it was time to do our big trip to southern Georgia to visit my in-laws. For New Year's, we ended up going to St. Augustine, FL--not realizing that the northeastern area of Florida was heavily spiking in flu cases. 
* Got hit with the illness a couple days after visiting St. Augustine. I am now on Day 6 of my own illness! In these six days I've experienced almost every cold/flu/cough symptom (except rash or runny nose).
* Had to call out sick for the first few days of 2026 because despite pain meds and all--my brain can't do anything without tremendous strain and effort. 

✨ Grateful that we are all still alive (so far)?
