# What I did during the company Winter Break

Every year, the company I work for takes off the last two weeks of the year. I took an extra week off because I forgot to take PTO earlier in the year! 

Lots of plans, lots of plans.

**Here's what I did:**

* Kid #2 got sick
* When they were all better, Kid #1 got really sick for 10 days
* We traveled to the Southeastern US--spiking in illness right now. 
* I am now on Day 6 of my own illness--all symptoms combined--and more! 

✨ Grateful that we are all still alive (so far)?
