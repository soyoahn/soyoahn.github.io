### Notes to self, for the next company hackathon
---

My company hosts an internal hackathon every year. As someone who routinely complains about not having enough autonomy, you'd think I'd be first in line for this. (Last year, I learned how to animate in [Spine](https://esotericsoftware.com/)! [My Pengu animations](/files/fun/apruchnicki-spine-animations.mp4)--the animation is janky... I realized halfway through that I filtered out some key controls, but I love him.)  

Unfortunately, the project I signed up for this year fell through, so I didn't participate much. But I could have. 

This blog post chronicles **what went wrong**, so I can remember what to do for the next one. 


## 1: There was no project intro call 

A kickoff meeting is always needed to gauge someone's general sentiment about a project. 

If someone isn't setting it up, be the person to set it up. 

Hackathons aren't real life; if you accidentally overstep, it's not a big deal.

I did make a page that outlined the thing we hoped to do:

![notion page for our project](/img/posts/2025/apruchnicki-failed-hackathon.png "*Made a notion page for the project with a small db of reference for the thing we hoped to do.*")

## 2. No contingency plans

I planned on not really feeling the hackathon this year and predicted that I'd only want to contribute docs. 

What I *hadn't* planned on was that last-minute urge to Do Some Shit™. I didn't keep tabs on backup projects. 

## 3: I didn't pursue my own project interests

I only looked for projects that could use my current job's skillsets, rather than going for a project I was interested in (or dreaming up and recruiting for my own). 

## 4: Don't be embarrassed to join a group

On Hackathon Day One, shortly after finding out that my original project was dead, I heard about a different one that really excited me, but I worried about joining last minute and being dead weight. 

Takeaway: Don't act weird, don't make people feel like they need to manage your feelings. Just join if you really want to and look for ways to remove friction. 

## ✨ Lessons Learned and Checklist for Next Year
1. **Only pitch ideas that I can actually help implement**. It *is* a hackathon, after all; not a document-a-thon. 
<br><br>Because I don't do production at this company and don't have expertise in how things are done here, this means: writing, contributing ideas, building a physical experience, video editing, webpage building, slack workflows, file management, and whatever else I can learn.<br><br>
For the next hackathon, I shouldn't forget that I can also help facilitate playtests and build things for people as they check in their work. I could also help unblock issues with central things like Perforce. I noticed later that lots of people were having trouble with Perforce and I could've helped unload the communication & support burden a bit so they could continue focusing on iterating. That's one thing I've been dying to do since I got here: help relieve the support burden. D'oh!<br><br>
2. **Join a project that excites me and feels ZINGY--not just one where I think I could be useful.** Should go without saying, but just in case. <br><br>
3. **Line up 1-3 backup projects within the <font color="red">two weeks</font> before hackathon.** Stash these on a page or calendar reminder so I don't forget. <br><br>
4. **If no one is project managing, just start looking ways to remove friction.** I don't know how to do production at this studio, but I *do* know how to resolve file conflicts and unblock general tech and p4 issues, and help communicate logistical things that people need to be aware of (like room changes, schedule updates, and special hackathon events/anything the team might miss because they're so heads down)--so I should keep that in mind next time I'm feeling sheepish about joining a larger team). <br><br>
5. **Don't worry about feeling like dead weight--go ahead and join a large team if the project sounds fun.** Classic reminder to myself that no one is thinking about you! (Also, Self: when have you ever actually been dead weight in a group project?)


## ✨ Actual Event Post-Mortem
<font color="#BF416F">Alright, the event is now completely over. Here are my raw takeaways: 
<ul>
<li>Next time, don't participate if I can't contribute in more ways than just "project manager" or "scribe." I'll only feel more useless and possibly slow things down. There just aren't a ton of things that
need to be collated into a doc during a hackathon. All the important details exist in chat anyway and can be turned into docs after the event. So if I want to participate, do **not** seek a scribe role. That's not the way for a hackathon.</li>
<li>Focus on finding a team where I can offer a useful perspective to contribute ideas or help do physical execution.</li>
<li>Work on improving a few skills: Video Production... will add more over time as I think of them.</li>
</ul></font>
