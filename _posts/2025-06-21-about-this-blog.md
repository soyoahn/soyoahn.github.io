## Blog Creation Notes
I wanted a simple place to post things and start reconnecting with people without any built-in social crap. 

Luckily, I found this generous template: [@chadbaldwin's Building a Free Blog with GitHub Pages in Minutes](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).

## Steps 
1. Followed these blog setup steps: https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html
	- Removed the RSS feed stuff by commenting out the following line in the `_config.yml` under plugins: `- jekyll-feed`
	- Removed the redundant nav item by removing the header from index.html
2. Added the comments feature by using https://utteranc.es/

âœ¨ Someday I'll sit down and update the styles to make it my own!
