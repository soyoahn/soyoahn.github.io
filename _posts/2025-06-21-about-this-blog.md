## Setting up this blog
I wanted a simple, free, ad-free, login-free place to post things and reconnect with people without any noisy social networking stuff.

Used this generous template from [@chadbaldwin](https://github.com/chadbaldwin): 
 - [Building a Free Blog with GitHub Pages in Minutes_](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)
 
**I repeat: I can't take any credit for this setup!** I'm simply sharing notes for some of the customizations I made on top of the template. You'll need some beginner-level experience with HTML, Markdown, and GitHub to follow along and create your own.

## Steps
To get the same blog setup you see here: 
1. Follow these steps: [https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) <br>Those steps will give you the whole setup. <br><br>The following steps are optional (what I did).<br><br>
2. Remove some noise: 
	1. **Remove RSS buttons** <br>If you don't want the RSS feed stuff, comment out the following line under **plugins** in the **_config.yml**: `- jekyll-feed`
	2. **Remove the extra homepage link** from the nav <br>Notice that a link to your index page shows up twice on every page: in the top left and on the top right. To remove the redundant index page nav item on the top right, convert all your <font color="#FF7A32">headers</font> in `index.html` to <font color="#FF7A32">bold</font> (Haven't had a chance to check if there's a smarter workaround.) 
	
3. Add the **Comments** feature by using [https://utteranc.es/](https://utteranc.es/). The form on that readme is how you generate the small snippet of code you include in your [`_includes/comments.html`](https://github.com/soyoahn/soyoahn.github.io/blob/4d45a93eb0e5d3e8518eb254974de5bd0bd8caab/_includes/comments.html).

4. Add a **Writing Samples** nav item by creating a couple new files: 
	1. In the `_includes` folder, create a `writingsamples.html` file. 
		- Add the following line of code, followed by your html or markdown: {% raw %}`{%- assign writingsamples = site.data.writingsamples -%}`{% endraw %}
	2. In your GitHub site's root folder (`_username_.github.io`), create a `writingsamples.md` file.
		- Add the block of code you see here: 
		{% raw %} 
		``` 
		--- 
		title: Writing Samples 
		layout: default 
		--- 
		{%- include writingsamples.html -%} 
		``` 
		{% endraw %}
		
		[Live Example](https://github.com/soyoahn/soyoahn.github.io/blob/main/writingsamples.md?plain=1)  - Note: Writing Samples is just one example. You could make a "Resume" or "Portfolio" one if you prefer! Just change the naming in those two files, including the filenames. 
		
		^^^ I don't know why this markdown formatting is so wonky, but I'll have to fix it later. 
		
âœ¨ What's Next: Someday I'll sit down and update the styles to make it my own!
