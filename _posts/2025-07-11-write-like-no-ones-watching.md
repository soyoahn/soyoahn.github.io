# Writing Like No One Is Watching

I don't know if it's okay to admit this, but I just realized I've been doing this a lot recently--writing below my standards--as an unintentional response to feeling like an absolute fish out of water. The byproduct of being asked to schism against my decades-long experience and training, is... shutting down a part of my brain and losing a large part of what made my work fun (close collaboration with my users on docs they urgently need--and seeing those docs used in action, refining them further). 

I used to have conversations that would elicit comments from engineers like, "you shouldn't be a technical writer, you should be an engineer," and "are you an engineer? You're also kind of QA--what are you exactly" or "that is some incredible insight... what made you think of that?" 

Here at my current company... I've had nothing like that. Only "you get too distracted" and "why are you doing that?--please, don't do that." I'm confident and experienced enough to not delude myself into thinking this has anything to do with me or my capabilities. 

Here, I've largely either felt overlooked and forced to work against my deepest work instincts. This oppressive and constant self-censorship, combined with a barrage of initiatives that are asking me to outsource the earliest and most creative stages of my thinking to AI/LLMs... it's no wonder that my motivation and self confidence has waned. 

To combat this downward spiral, I've been pouring my energy into improving what I *can*: updating my document design skills, refining my review and publishing process, reading everything I can on graphic design (something I've never been great at), and so on. 

That's it, that's the post.
