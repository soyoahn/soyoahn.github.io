## What am I getting into? (Questions for the Job Interview)

### Do you have any questions for me? 
Yes: 
- Who owns decisions about the documentation? 
- Let's run an example scenario of that! Let's say the navigation isn't working and no one is able to find anything. I want to rearchitect and add some metadata. Who do I need to approve that and when I can start doing this work? I need to reach out to the leads among our users--can I grab some time with them? Does anyone need to approve that? 
- Let's run another scenario! I want to run an audit of all our existing knowledge and how it's being used and shared today (e.g., with external folks). I think this audit will take 1 month if I want to get good information I'll feel comfortable making decisions around. How should I go about doing this audit? Who do I need to check with? How would I obtain access to all the areas where information  might exist? 
- How are performance reviews done and how important are they? 
- How do you feel about embedding? 
- What are your pet peeves? 
- What does success look like? 
- Who are your customers and what are their biggest pain points? 
- What documents are successful today? Or, in what areas is your knowledge strong in folks today? Why is that knowledge strong? 
- When's the last time you shared your docs externally? What teams need to do this and why? 
- How to people gain access to the docs?

âœ¨ I love technical writing, but in the wrong circumstances, it can be torture. In my level of seniority, autonomy and the ability to make decisions is important to me.
