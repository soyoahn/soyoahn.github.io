## Job Interview Questions
> Early career folks, look away!

## Do you have any questions for me? 
Yes. (This isn't a comprehensive list, but these are ones I don't want to forget for my next career move.) 

### What Is My Role, Actually?
- What are your goals and vision for the docs and what would be my specific role in it? 

### Who Makes Docs Decisions?
- How is work prioritized? Who sets the priorities? Do you care how I intake requests directly from users? 
- How do you feel about embedding on teams where users are? 
- Who owns decisions about the documentation? 
    - Let's run an example scenario of that! Let's say that the navigation is all over the place and users complain that they rarely know what they're looking for. I want to rearchitect the knowledge center and add some metadata. Who would need to approve before I can begin the work? 
    - Let's run another scenario! I want to run an audit of all our existing knowledge and how it's being used and shared today. I think this audit will take one month of dedicated work if I want to get good enough information. How should I go about doing this audit? Who do I need to check with? How would I obtain access to all the areas where information might exist? 

### Team Structure
- How many direct reports does my functional manager have?
- (If the answer to the previous question is that I'd be the only one: What percentage of their success or failure is directly dependent on what I do?) // Here, I'm trying to suss out whether the manager will be risk-averse and overly controlling because my potential failure is too tied to their performance metrics. Let me know if there's a better way to do that!)

### What's Important To You? 
- How are performance reviews done and how important are they to you? 
- What does success look like? Who determines whether things are successful? 
- What is the pie chart for what I should be doing at any given time, among these items:
    1. Doing some frontline product support
	2. Information Architecture
	3. Docs Strategy
	4. Docs Infrastructure
	5. Writing documentation
	6. Testing the stuff I'm supposed to be documenting
	7. Other

### What Do You Know About Your Users?
- Who are your customers and what are their biggest pain points? How are their pain points being addressed today?
- What's an example of a current top-of-mind docs need for the team?
- What documents are successful today? Where is knowledge weak and where is knowledge strong? 
- How is dev support done today? Who supports your users with problems they're having with the proprietory tools I'd be documenting? How's the relationship going between those two groups? 
- (For Internal Docs) When's the last time you shared your docs externally? What teams need to do this and why? 
- (For Internal Docs) How do people gain access to the docs? How much of that is owned by the docs team versus IT? 

âœ¨ Why these questions? 
I can handle expectations for <font color="#B33F00">high impact x high autonomy</font> OR <font color="#B33F00">average impact x low autonomy</font>. What's hard is when <font color="#B33F00">high impact x low autonomy</font> is expected at the same time that a docs system is admittedly **failing**. 

As a senior writer with the types of experiences (and customer successes) I've had, I don't do well with arbitrary decision-making gatekeeping around docs. There's too much I'll want to do and I'll be frustrated if I'm told I can't do them for arbitrary, hypothetical, or imaginary reasons. Stashing these questions for the future.
