## Do you have any questions for me? 
Yes: 

### What Is My Role, Actually?
- What are your goals and vision for the docs and what would be my specific role in it? 

### Who Makes Docs Decisions?
- How is work prioritized? Who sets the priorities? Do you care how I intake requests directly from users? 
- How do you feel about embedding on teams where users are? 
- Who owns decisions about the documentation? 
    - Let's run an example scenario of that! Let's say that the navigation is all over the place and users complain that they rarely know what they're looking for. I want to rearchitect the knowledge center and add some metadata. Who would need to approve before I can begin the work? 
    - Let's run another scenario! I want to run an audit of all our existing knowledge and how it's being used and shared today. I think this audit will take one month of dedicated work if I want to get good enough information. How should I go about doing this audit? Who do I need to check with? How would I obtain access to all the areas where information might exist? 

### What's Important To You? 
- How are performance reviews done and how important are they to you? 
- What does success look like? Who determines whether things are successful? 
- What is the pie chart for what I should be doing at any given time, among these items:
    1. Doing some frontline product support
	2. Information Architecture
	3. Docs Strategy
	4. Docs Infrastructure
	5. Writing documentation
	6. Testing the stuff I'm supposed to be documenting
	7. Other

### What Do You Know About Your Users?
- Who are your customers and what are their biggest pain points? How are their pain points being addressed today?
- What documents are successful today? Where is knowledge weak and where is knowledge strong? 
- (For Internal Docs) When's the last time you shared your docs externally? What teams need to do this and why? 
- (For Internal Docs) How do people gain access to the docs? How much of that is owned by the docs team versus IT? 

âœ¨ I love technical writing, but in rare circumstances it can be torture (I can handle high accountability x high autonomy OR low accountability x low autonomy. What I can't stand is when someone expects high accountability x low autonomy from a senior writer with the types of experience I've had. Stashing these questions for the future.
