# My Joy Runbook
---

This is meant for me, but I recommending trying to start your own "joy runbook" as you collect inspiration, advice, and ideas that work for you when you fall into a funk.

When feeling super bad, try these things and don't skip steps: <br>
**‚è± Completion time: 1-2h** | Might seem like lot now, but it sure beats being in your funk for days.

1. üé∂ **Listen**: [I Am... I Said (Neil Diamond)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA5bFJt9Wp0) (3m 35s)

1. Drink water.
2. **If wfh**: Water the plants ü™¥. If it's time for a comprehensive watering sesh, do the full deep water + soak. If the plants don't need water, go for a bike ride. (30m)<br>
**If at the office**: Get a hot beverage ‚òï and take a **walk outside**--don't just sit inside. (30m)
3. üîâ **Listen**: To something fun or a good interview. (30m) <br>Options: [Bullseye with Jesse Thorn](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/bullseye-with-jesse-thorn/)<br>
4. Feeling refreshed? Skip to 3Ô∏è‚É£. <br>If you still need a little more, take a few minutes to learn something new (30-45m)  <br>Options: [BBC Radio 4 - In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl), Video production tutorials, Jewelry making or wood working tutorials

1. **Read**: [Fear is the mind killer](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2-i-must-not-fear-fear-is-the-mind-killer-fear-is) 
2. Now start the next task that needs doing.
