# My Joy Runbook
---

This is meant for me, but I recommending trying to start your own "joy runbook" as you collect inspiration, advice, and ideas that work for you when you fall into a funk.

When feeling super bad, try these things and don't skip steps: 
**Completion time: ⏲️1-2h** | Might seem like lot now, but it sure beats being in your funk for days. 

## 1️⃣ Do a Productive Wallow
1. Listen: [I Am... I Said (Neil Diamond)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA5bFJt9Wp0) (3m 35s)

## 2️⃣ Heal
1. If WFH: Water my plants. If it's time for a comprehensive watering sesh, do the full deep water + soak. (30m)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If at the office: Get a hot beverage and walk **outside**--don't just sit inside. (30m)
2. Listen: To something fun or a good interview. (30m) Options:<br>[Bullseye with Jesse Thorn](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/bullseye-with-jesse-thorn/)<br>
3. Feeling refreshed? Skip to 3️⃣. If you still need a little more, take a few minutes to learn something new: (30-45m) Options: <br>[BBC Radio 4 - In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl)<br>Video production tutorials<br>Jewelry making or wood working tutorials

## 3️⃣ Rise
1. Read: [Fear is the mind killer](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2-i-must-not-fear-fear-is-the-mind-killer-fear-is) 
2. Now start the next task that needs doing.
