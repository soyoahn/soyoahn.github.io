## Backlog of Blog Post Ideas

> ðŸ¤” I've noticed a trend... I always start a new blog when I'm trying to reach out and connect to the world. 
> Once I'm feeling connected or whatever, I abandon the blog. 
> This time, I'm mostly doing it to regain my sense of self outside of work.

### Technical Writing
Musings about this wild craft.
* Internal Style Guide: I'd like to share my quickest version of a contributor's guide. And the reasoning behind why mine is a quick one pager.
* Docs requested by the reader (just send me an email request or a comment and I'll try to make it happen). The only downside to internal docs writing is that it's hard to generate shareable professional samples for future jobs. 
* Since I get asked all the time: What I think about AI (spoiler: Please don't use it to outsource any of your thinking. Your neuroplastic brain will adapt to all your cut corners and it won't be pretty.) 
* Why you need a technical writer who cares about the whole information experience (example: docs migration - updating systems outside of docs system with updated links) 
* My checklist before taking on any other job. [Started here: [Job Interview Questions](../../06/06/job-interview-questions.html)]
* Just a long post/rant explaining that it is partly your job as a tech writer to *get your docs read*. If they're not being read, you should reconsider the content and how you're presenting the info. 

### My Game Dev Journey 
Answers to common questions so I can just share a link.
* How I got here, How I moved to mutiplayer maps production (spoiler: sheer luck and people who believed in me)
* Why I left a dream job
* Why I love doing internal technical writing in games and how I think it's different from other tech writing (or should be)

### Motherhood
Hey, it's half of my identity now (the more important half). How could I _not_ write about it?
* I'd like to share a succinct chronology of my daughter's birth journey. It's the wildest thing I've ever experienced in my life and it's something I'd like to share with more people but I want to make the information pull, rather than pushing it to those for whom birth stories are a painful topic. ðŸ§¡
* Our child raising recipe thus far and commentary about which advice from experts resonated and what advice we modified--because all kids are different (spoiler: authoritative + gentle parenting, focus on play + exploration (let them fall and get hurt within reason), germs are our friends (within reason), solid starts, oh crap potty training, no "passive" screentime, and so on). 
* Aspects of parenting I'm still struggling with 


### Public Documentation For Myself
If I can share whatever docs I'm writing for myself, I'll just share it here.
* Touring preschools for choice programs
* Other parenthood stuff like our potty training playbook 
* The bullet list of parenting philosophy (spoiler: let kids experience boredom, help them reach out of their comfort zones, remember they are so little and our crazy schedules are incomprehensible to them--allot 15 extra minutes between everything so you can give them 5min to explore that weird bug on the sidewalk)
* Backgammon setup and quick reference
* Gin Rummy quick reminder
* How I'd Build My Dream Community (If I Would Accept Just A Tiny Bit Of Social Discomfort To Reap Theoretical Benefits)
* A few baking recipes (my visual method).

*Lessons Learned*

âœ¨ Let's do this thing! I'm going to edit this post as I go; possibly striking out and adding links as I (hopefully) complete the entries.
