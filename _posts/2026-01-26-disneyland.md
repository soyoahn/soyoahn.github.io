## 1-Day Trip to Disneyland 

> Capturing some notes so I don't forget later. 

---

Note: We're not doing the Lighting Pass because we have two small kids who aren't tall enough for most Lighting Pass-eligible rides yet. We're going just for the 1 Day, 1 Park.

### <font color="#BF59F4">1. Pick the date(s)</font>
As of this writing, park tickets are priced to specific days and you need to reserve the dates at time of purchase. (And actively change the reservation if you need to later.) 

Always check these sites before booking: 
* **Discounts**: [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/offers-discounts/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/offers-discounts/)
* **Hours & Events Calendar**: [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/calendars/day/#/disneyland/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/calendars/day/#/disneyland/)
  * Fireworks don't happen every day, for example. If a particular event is important, book on a day that has them. 
  * Some nights, the park will close early for After-Hours Special Events.
  * Expand *Closed for Refurbishment* to check what's closed for refurbishment. 
* **Check Crowds**: these sites are not perfect, but it's more data to look at to help you make decisions
  * Is it packed: [https://www.isitpacked.com/disneyland-crowd-forecast-predictor-calendar/](https://www.isitpacked.com/disneyland-crowd-forecast-predictor-calendar/)
	* Remember though, a day might be less busy because the park has shorter hours that day or lacks certain events.
  * Queue Times: [https://queue-times.com/en-US/parks/16/calendar/](https://queue-times.com/en-US/parks/16/calendar/)
  * Thrill Data: [https://www.thrill-data.com/trip-planning/crowd-calendar/disneyland](https://www.thrill-data.com/trip-planning/crowd-calendar/disneyland)
* *Dining Reservations*: [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/dining/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/dining/) or the Disneyland app (login required on both)
  * For example, if you have a must-have dining wish at a sit-down restaurant, you ought to check availability--you can book 60 days in advance (can be cancelled up to 2 hrs or 24 hrs, depending on the place, before the actual reservation at the time of this writing to avoid a $10/pp penalty fee) or book outside that window and set an alarm 60 days out to book your dining.
* *Weather (?)*: Depending on how far out the date is, I *suppose* you could check the forecast!

### 2. <font color="#FF5003">Book your hotel and whatever other logistics</font>
I don't have a hack for this yet.

### 3. <font color="#FC9020">Small kids stuff</font>
* Stroller size restrictions - [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/faq/parks/strollers/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/faq/parks/strollers/)
* Pack for rain (stroller rain cover, rain coats, rain boots) or sun (sunscreen, hats, sunglasses, fan), depending on the weather
* Nights can get *cold* - pack a warm layer
* Take kids potty before standing in a long line, and at least every 2 hours
* Keep kids hydrated so they stay feeling good
* Change kids into PJs before or after the tram so they can go right to sleep on the drive home.
* Misc packing list: 
  * Water bottles for everyone
  * Portable sound soother
  * Snacks (5 small apples, 4 bananas, goldfish, made good granola bites)
  * Wet wipes (for quick cleanup after snacks and meals)
  * Quick dry towel, just in case
  * Change of clothes for the kids, just in case
  * Power bank(s)
  * For the car: Toothbrushes, toothpaste, PJs

### 4. <font color="#853DEE">Plan a brief itinerary</font>
Example: In this scenario, we've picked a mid-week school day, booked a hotel for the night before the big day, and plan to drive home afterwards.

✅ Check ride heights in advance for kiddos. <br>
✅ Wait times on the app are useful--especially for temporary closures--but I shouldn't flock to faraway low wait times.<br>
✅ Get familiar with the app & map far in advance of the trip (wait times, dining reservations, mobile ordering, events, and so on). <br>

✨ This plan is probably a little too packed. 

1. <font color="gray">6:30am</font> Have the car packed and have a light breakfast at hotel
2. <font color="gray">7:15am</font> Drive out to the parking structure, get on tram, get through security
3. <font color="D6117D">8:00am</font> Beeline to Peter Pan's Flight, Alice in Wonderland (the two longest waits) and whatever other Fantasyland rides we can fit (Snow White, Storybook Land Canal Boats, Casey Jr)
4. <font color="D6117D">9:00am</font> Plaza Inn reservation for character dining breakfast (I wish I'd booked this for 9:30am or 10am instead)
5. <font color="D6117D">10am - 12pm</font> **Fantasyland** (All the dark rides + Storybook Canal Boats + Casey Jr) **OR** Move onto New Orleans Square if it's too busy or if the kids want to move on (drop by **Jolly Holiday** on the way to Bayou/New Orleans)
6. <font color="19B019">12pm - 3pm</font> **New Orleans Square** (must-rides: Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, Disneyland Railroad) + **Get Lunch** (Cafe Orleans) + **30+ minute nap** + 🚂 Take the train from <font color="red">New Orleans Square</font> to <font color="red">Mickey's Toontown</font>. 
7. <font color="19B019">3pm - 5pm</font> **Toontown** (must-rides: Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, visit houses) + 🚂 Take the train from <font color="red">Toontown</font> to <font color="red">New Orleans Square</font> to get to Bayou Country.
8. <font color="53C2BF">5pm - 7pm</font> **Bayou Country** (must-rides: **Winnie the Pooh**) + **Get Dinner** (Tiana's Palace or Hungry Bear) 
9. <font color="53C2BF">7pm - 8pm</font> **Adventureland** - skippable - (must-rides: Jungle Cruise, Enchanted Tiki Room) - this places us very close to the hub/main street for the parade.
10. <font color="53C2BF">8pm</font> Find a spot to watch Paint the Night. **8:30pm - Paint the Night parade** main street is the best viewing; paths from it's a small world → matterhorn → main street. Grab treats at **Jolly Holiday**
11. <font color="53C2BF">9pm - 10pm</font> Depending on the time, either go home or explore Star Wars area (just look at the things) or Tomorrowland (do Astro Blasters and/or Autopia)

Whenever the kids nap, mom or dad can go check out a single rider line: 
* [Disneyland - Single Rider](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disneyland/#/single-rider-line/sort=location/)

### 5. <font color="#7D5BEA">Food wish list</font>
1. Kettle corn or caramel corn (daughter's #1)
2. Jolly Holiday treats + grilled cheese w/tomato soup
3. Little Red Wagon corn dog
4. Maurice's Treats garlic cheesy pretzel bread
5. Some sort of ice cream thing
6. Churro
