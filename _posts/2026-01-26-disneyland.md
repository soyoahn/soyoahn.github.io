Note: I'm not doing Lighting Pass because we have two small kids who aren't tall enough for most Lighting Pass-eligible rides yet. We're going just for the 1 Day, 1 Park.

### 1. Pick the date(s)
As of this writing, park tickets are priced to specific days and you need to reserve the day at time of purchase. (And actively change the reservation if you need to.) 

Always check these sites before booking: 
* *Discounts*: [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/offers-discounts/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/offers-discounts/)
* *Hours & Events Calendar*: [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/calendars/day/#/disneyland/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/calendars/day/#/disneyland/)
  * Fireworks don't happen every day, for example. If a particular event is important, book on a day that has them. 
  * Expand *Closed for Refurbishment* to check what's closed for refurbishment. 
* *Check Crowds*: these sites are not perfect, but it's more data to look at to help your decision
  * Is it packed: [https://www.isitpacked.com/disneyland-crowd-forecast-predictor-calendar/](https://www.isitpacked.com/disneyland-crowd-forecast-predictor-calendar/)
	* Remember though, a day might be less busy because the park has shorter hours that day or lacks certain events.
  * Queue Times: [https://queue-times.com/en-US/parks/16/calendar/](https://queue-times.com/en-US/parks/16/calendar/)
  * Thrill Data: [https://www.thrill-data.com/trip-planning/crowd-calendar/disneyland](https://www.thrill-data.com/trip-planning/crowd-calendar/disneyland)
* *Dining Reservations*: [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/dining/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/dining/) or the Disneyland app (login required on both)
  * For example, if you have a must-have dining reservation, you ought to check availability--you can book 60 days in advance--or book outside that window and set an alarm 60 days out to book your dining.

### 2. Book your hotel and whatever other logistics
I don't have a hack for this yet.

### 3. Small kids stuff
* Stroller size restrictions - [https://disneyland.disney.go.com/faq/parks/strollers/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/faq/parks/strollers/)
* Pack for rain (stroller rain cover, rain coats, rain boots) or sun (sunscreen, hats, sunglasses, fan), depending on the weather
* Night gets cooold - pack a warm layer for night
* Take kids potty before standing in a long line, and at least every 2 hours
* Keep kids hydrated so they stay feeling good
* Pack PJs to change kids into before or after tram so they can go right to sleep on the drive home.
* Misc packing list: 
  * Water bottles for everyone
  * Portable sound soother
  * Wet wipes (for quick cleanup after snacks and meals)
  * Quick dry towel, just in case
  * Change of clothes for the kids, just in case
  * Power bank(s)

### 4. Plan a brief itinerary 
Example: In this scenario, we've picked a mid-week school day, booked a hotel for the night before the big day, and plan to drive home afterwards.

✅ Check ride heights in advance for kiddos. 
✅ Wait times on the app are useful--especially for temporary closures--but I shouldn't flock to faraway low wait times.
✅ Get familiar with the app & map far in advance of the trip (wait times, dining reservations, mobile ordering, events, and so on). 

✨ This plan is probably a little too packed. 

1. 6:30am - Have the car packed and have a light breakfast at hotel
2. 7:15am - Drive out to the parking structure, get on tram, get through security
3. 8:00am - Beeline to Peter Pan's Flight and whatever other Fantasyland rides
4. 9:00am - Plaza Inn reservation for character dining breakfast
6. 10am - 12pm - Fantasyland (All the dark rides + Storybook Canal Boats)
7. 12pm - 3pm - New Orleans Square (must-rides: Haunted Mansion, Pirates of the Caribbean, Disneyland Railroad) + **Get Lunch** (Cafe Orleans) + **30+ minute nap**
8. 3pm - 5pm - Toontown (must-rides: Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, visit houses)
9. 5pm - 7pm - Bayou Country (must-rides: **Winnie the Pooh**) + **Get Dinner** (Tiana's Palace or Hungry Bear) 
10. 7pm - 8pm - Adventureland (must-rides: Jungle Cruise, Enchanted Tiki Room) - this places us very close to the hub/main street.
11: 8pm - Find a spot to watch Paint the Night. **8:30pm - Paint the Night parade** main street is the best viewing; paths from it's a small world → matterhorn → main street
12: 9pm - 10pm - Explore Star Wars area, maybe do Astro Blasters and/or Autopia

### 5. Food wish list
1. Jolly Holiday treats + grilled cheese w/tomato soup
2. Little Red Wagon corn dog
3. Maurice's Treats garlic cheesy pretzel bread
4. Some sort of ice cream thing
5. Churro
6. Kettle corn (daughter's #1)
