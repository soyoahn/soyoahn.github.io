# What I did during the company Mid-Year Break

Every year, the company I work for takes off the whole week of July 4th. 

This was that week!

**Here's what I did:**

* [x] **[Move our son to his own bed!](#room)**
* [x] [Get more outdoor plants](#plants)
* [x] [Brush up on UX and Content Design](#ux)
* [x] [Set up my SFV Vanpool proposal](#vanpool)
* [ ] [Shop for a new car](#car)


## Move our son to his own bed! {#room}

The key, important thing we needed to do this break was to move our two-year-old (who'd been co-sleeping with us till now) to his sister's room--the room they'll need to share for the forseeable future. 

The Monday of Mid-Year Break, we started the day at IKEA.

<summary>Aside: There was a UX quagmire there...</summary>
<p>We ended up waiting 2 hours to receive the Click-to-Collect order I placed days earlier.</p>

Problems: 
<ul>
<li>Vestigial prearranged pickup time placed with the order</li>
<li>Messaging that strung us along for hours that our order would be ready shortly</li>
<li>Reassurance from employees in person that everything was in order</li>
<li>At the near-two hour mark: a different shift of confused employees root-caused the issue as us failing to responding to texts (so they thought we had "left" even though we were sitting in the waiting room)</li>
<li>Those aforementioned text messages kept thanking us for our patience and assuring us that our order would be ready soon, with no indication of needing or expecting a reply:<br> <img src="/img/posts/2025/ikea-click-to-collect-texts.jpg" alt="IKEA Click to Collect Messaging going from 11:17am till 1pm">
</li>
</ul>
</details>

We got home and put together our newly acquired twin Vevelstad bed, started the bedtime routine at 7:30pm, got the kid in bed in his sister's room by 9:30pm, repeat. 

Overall this went way more smoothly than either of expected (perpetually knocking on wood). I planned the week on the assumption that bedtimes would be hard and that I'd be operating on truly zero sleep. A little bummed that I didn't plan an "if all goes well" contingency to make more out of the week, but the most important thing got done (albeit on the first day), so. Uh, victory.


## Get more outdoor plants {#plants}
Got these to spruce up our tiny patio: 

![Watering guide for all my new plants: Misting and humidity for the creeping fig, wax plant, and zebra fern. Constant mosture for the parsley. Allow the english thyme and bbq rosemary to dry out completely between waterings.](/img/posts/2025/apruchnicki-new-2025-plants.png)

This took our houseplant count up to 26. üòÅ
(I don't think the creeping fig is going to make it though.)

## Brush up on UX and Content Design {#ux}
Stumbled upon and finished this book: 

[![User Friendly: How the hidden rules of design are changing the way we live, work, and play](/img/posts/2025/user-friendly-kuang-fabricant.jpg)](https://www.mcdbooks.com/books/user-friendly)

I need to say more about this book later, but I'll jot down a few notes now from the good ol' stream of consciousness: 
- Industrial Design is 100% the field I should've studied and pursued. Where the design goals are around safety, usability, and failure prevention. This practice appears to be not quite as susceptible to non-user-serving agendas that all other design practices inevitably tend to fall into. 
- I remembered that my original dream was to design human factors for car interfaces. Why and when did I totally forget about that dream? 
- UX and Product Design practitioners are experiencing their "Oppenheimer" moment--reckoning with all the fallout that ease of use and devising frictionless engagement has wrought. (Fallout examples: attention/distraction crisis, tech and social media addictions, loss of skills and the ability to quickly react to unexpected problems because of certain types of automation)
- A must-read for everyone living in the world today to become "informed, critical consumers of design." The book provides beautifully curated design anecdotes and histories, and in doing so--I think--gives a comprehensive, root-cause analytical summary for future generations to strive for better. 
- *("Is this an Asana ad?")* The Asana segment was a little jarring to me.
- Overall, I think this book is a wonderful love letter to every person who is drawn to UX for its deeply rewarding insight and empathy puzzles.
- It felt a little surreal reading the Afterward; some of the sentences uttered were ones I've said verbatim at work countless times--I think if I shared it with certain coworkers they'd still somehow miss the advice to start with specific users before all else.

## Set up my SFV Vanpool proposal {#vanpool}
I enjoy going into office, but it's been rough on our cars. The company I work for offers a vanpool program. I need enough coworkers to fill up the vanpool's **3 days per week with a passenger present each day** requirement to get this off the ground. Wish me luck! üçÄ

## Shop for a new car {#car}
So, the Tuesday before break was Take-Your-Kid-To-Work Day (a half-day affair complete with breakfast, lunch, ice cream, music, dancing, crafts, and activities for the kids). 

We came home around 2pm and I took a meeting from my desk at home while my husband took the kids to the grocery store. On the way, a Range Rover ran a red light and... I mean, almost t-boned the tiny Ford C-Max holding my whole family in it. Everyone came out relatively unscathed, thankfully, but the car was a total loss. 

Witnesses emerged to offer their testimony (which was great because we didn't own a dash cam), but the investigation took two weeks and we only got word yesterday (4th of July, the Friday before I return to work) that we were officially deemed not at fault by the insurance company. 

We should've taken the opportunity to test drive and shop for cars this week (with the kids in school and all), but car stuff has officially exhausted us. I was rear-ended (at a long-standing red light!) back in February and shelled out more money than I should have to pay the Damage Waiver on the insurance-provided rental while my car got repaired. Then only a couple months later, we had to replace the tires and I told my husband to "buy the expensive ones" because this was my commuter car and our family car. 

All that to say, we are not looking forward to car shopping in the slightest. üòî

## Impromptu stuff
* Whole family went to see Elio. I loved it, cried a lot, and appreciated its beautiful moments.
* Stumbled upon [Burton Chace Park](https://beaches.lacounty.gov/burton-chace-park/) in Marina Del Rey and the kids had fun enjoying the perfect breeze there. 
* Took out the crockpot and made some stuff
* Baked mini muffins
