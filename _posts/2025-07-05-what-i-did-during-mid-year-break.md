# What I did during my company's mid-year break

Every year, the company I work for takes off the entire week that July 4th is observed. 

This was that week! Here's what I did. 
---

**Goals**
Going in, here's how I wanted to spend the break:

* [x] [Move kiddo #2 to his own bed!](#room)
* [x] [Get more outdoor plants](#plants)
* [x] [Brush up on UX and Content Design](#ux)
* [x] [Set up my SFV Vanpool proposal](#vanpool)
* [ ] Visit Home Goods (Oh well, another time. It's been actual years (plural) since I've set foot in a Home Goods.) 
* [ ] Clothes shopping (Oh well)
* [ ] [Shop for a new car](#car)


## Move kiddo #2 to his own bed! {#room}

The key thing we wanted to accomplish this break was moving our 2yo son (who'd been co-sleeping with us till now) to his sister's room--the room they'll need to share for the forseeable future. 

The Monday of Mid-Year Break, we started the day at IKEA. We ended up waiting 2 hours to pick up the Click-to-Collect order I placed days earlier.

<summary>Aside: There was a UX quagmire there...</summary>
Vestigial prearranged pickup time placed with the order, messaging that strung us along for hours that our order would be ready shortly, confused employees that blamed us for not responding to texts, text messages that kept thanking us for our patience and assuring us that our order would be ready soon, etc)

## Get more outdoor plants {#plants}
Got these to spruce up our tiny patio:

## Brush up on UX and Content Design (#ux)
Stumbled upon and finished this book: 

[![User Friendly: How the hidden rules of design are changing the way we live, work, and play](/img/posts/2025/user-friendly-kuang-fabricant.jpg)](https://www.mcdbooks.com/books/user-friendly)

I need to say more about this book later, but here's a few notes from the stream of consciousness: 
- Industrial Design is 100% the field I should've studied and pursued. Where the design goals are around safety, usability, and failure prevention, rather than sales and engagement. 
- I remembered that my original dream was to design human factors for car interfaces. Why and when did I totally forget about that dream? 
- The book concludes that UX is in its "Oppenheimer" moment (our attention crisis, tech and social media addiction, and loss of skills and the ability to quickly react to unexpected problems due to things like automation) 
- I think this book is a must-read. Also I think it's a love letter to every person in a UX or UX-adjacent role who originally entered this field for all the right reasons. 

## Set up my SFV Vanpool proposal
I enjoy going into office, but it's been rough on our cars. The company I work for offers a vanpool program. I need enough coworkers to fill up the vanpool's **3 days per week with a passenger present each day** requirement to get this off the ground. Wish me luck! üçÄ

## Shop for a new car {#car}
So, the Tuesday before break was Take-Your-Kid-To-Work Day (a half-day affair complete with breakfast, lunch, ice cream, music, dancing, crafts, and activities for the kids). 

We came home around 2pm and I took a meeting from my desk at home while my husband took the kids to the grocery store. On the way, a Range Rover ran a red light and... I mean, almost t-boned the tiny Ford C-Max holding my whole family in it. They came out relatively unscathed, but the car was a total loss. 

Witnesses emerged to offer their testimony (which was great because we didn't own a dash cam), but the investigation took two weeks and we only got word yesterday (4th of July, the Friday before I return to work) that we were officially deemed not at fault by the insurance company. 

We should've taken the opportunity to test drive and shop for cars this week (with the kids in school and all), but car stuff has officially exhausted us. I was rear-ended (at a long-standing red light!!!) back in February and shelled out more money than I should have to pay the Damage Waiver on the rental car that the other person's insurance provided while mine got repaired. Then only a couple months later, we had to replace the tires and I told my husband to "buy the expensive ones" because this was my commuter car and our family car. 

All that to say, we are not looking forward to car shopping in the slightest. üòî

## Unplanned stuff
* Whole family went to see Elio. It was great! 
* Stumbled upon [Burton Chace Park](https://beaches.lacounty.gov/burton-chace-park/) in Marina Del Rey and the kids had fun enjoying the perfect breeze there. 
* Took out the crockpot and made some stuff
* Baked mini muffins 

‚ú® Grateful to have a job that lets me go and buy plants for a week, and that my family didn't get hurt in that accident.
