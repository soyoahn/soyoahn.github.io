## Why Share This Backlog?

> ðŸ¤” I always start a new blog when I'm trying to reach out and connect to the world. 
> This time, I'm mostly doing it to regain my sense of self and explain my work identity outside of whatever job I'm at at the time, since layoffs are always looming. 

Here are some topics I want to cover... now it's just a matter of sitting down and doing some quick writing outside of work and being present with the kids. I'm hoping that if I post this backlog somewhere, I'm more likely to do the thing.

#### Technical Writing

* Style Guide for Internal Docs in Games: I'd like to share my quickest version of a style guide. It's barebones and one I always start with wherever I go... there's nothing secret or mysterious in there, so why not share a slice of what I think is most important for documentation contributors to know? 
* Docs for stuff that people would like better docs for (just send me an email request or a comment and I'll try to make it happen). The only downside to internal docs writing is that it's hard to generate professional samples for future jobs. So I'll create some samples in my own time for the anyone who needs it. 
* Since I get asked all the time: What I think about AI (don't use it to outsource any of your thinking. Use it only to do things that were previously impossible) 
* Recipe using my visual method
* Why you need a technical writer (docs migration - updating systems outside of docs system with updated links) 
* My checklist before taking on any other job. 

#### My Game Dev Journey 
* How I got there, How I moved to MP, Why I left a dream job
* Why I love doing technical writing in games and how I think it's different from other tech writing


#### Motherhood

* I'd like to share a succinct chronology of my daughter's birth journey. It's the wildest thing I've ever experienced in my life and it's something I'd like to share with more people but I want to make the information pull, rather than pushing it to people who could have triggers. ðŸ§¡
* Our child raising recipe thus far and commentary about which aspects of advice from experts resonated and what we changed because all kids are different  (authoritative + gentle parenting, focus on play + exploration (let them fall and get hurt within reason), solid starts, oh crap potty training, no passive screentime, and so on). 
* Aspects of parenting I'm still struggling with 


#### Public Documentation For My Own Self
* Touring preschools for choice programs
* Other parenthood stuff like our potty training playbook 
* The bullet list of parenting philosophy
* Backgammon setup and quick reference
* Gin Rummy quick reminder
* How I'd Build My Dream Community (If I Would Just Accept A Tiny Bit Of Social Discomfort To Reap Theoretical Benefits)


*Lessons Learned*

âœ¨ Let's do this thing! I'm going to edit this post as I go; possibly striking out and adding a link as I (hopefully) complete the entries.
