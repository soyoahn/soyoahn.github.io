# Mental Health | iOS Messages Feature Request
---
Did you know that you can send feature requests to Apple through a nice, dedicated form? [https://www.apple.com/feedback/](https://www.apple.com/feedback/)

For example, I just submitted this one: (this is pretty personal) 

I have a family member who sends me very upsetting messages almost daily. I've needed to block them occasionally, but can't leave them blocked for very long because they are family. Rather than constantly block/unblock, I'd rather have the ability to obfuscate or hide the preview contents of their message so I don't have to catch any words from them while checking other messages. I'd like to only have to view the content when I'm mentally and emotionally prepared to do so. 

"Silence Notifications From <specific people" is very useful but not enough because I can still see the last couple lines from the person, and if the words are pretty terrible, it's very hard to focus on work/kids/life, etc. 

Currently, I'm using my hand to hide the words but sometimes I forget. Always hiding the preview text would be ideal.
