# Mental Health / iOS Messages Feature Request
---
Did you know that you can send Apple feature requests? https://www.apple.com/feedback/

For example, I just submitted this one: 

I have a family member who sends me very upsetting messages almost daily. I've occasionally blocked this person, but can't do so for very long because they are family. Rather than constantly "block/unblock," I'd rather have the ability to obfuscate or hide the contents of their message so I don't have to catch any words from them while checking other messages. I'd like to only have to view the content when I'm mentally prepared to do so. 

"Silence Notifications From <specific people" is very useful but not enough because I can still see the last couple lines from the person, and if the words are pretty terrible, it's very hard to focus on work/kids/life, etc. Currently, I'm using my hand to hide the words but sometimes I forget. Hiding the preview words would be ideal.
