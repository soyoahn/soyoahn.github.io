----## Blue Crayon Note

> ☀️ Today was my last day of PTO so I decided to start a blog to chronicle some things. They're public because life is short and I'm getting old.

Here's a thing that happened last week.

### Laundry Day

#### We forgot to check the pockets. 

We ran a quick load!  
But when the dryer was done  
The inside was... blue.

#### Okay, now the inside of the dryer is blue.
We did our best to clean it, but there was still some left.

The inside of the dryer is still a little blue (da ba dee). 

So we let our HOA President know and we made this note to warn our neighbors: 

![There's a sheet of white printer paper posted to the top of a dryer. The note on it is written with what appears to be a blue crayon and the text reads: "A blue crayon has discolored the dryer. It has not discolored our clothes on subsequent washes, but FYI. - Unit B"](/img/posts/2025/blue-crayon-note.png)

A neighbor reached out to say they thought it was funny that the note was written in blue crayon. :) 

*Lessons Learned*
* Do your best to fix the problem! 
* Let people know what happened. Own up to your mistakes. 
* Tailor your docs to your audience! Blue crayon in this situation set the tone and expectations before the reader even processes a single word. (I would _not_ have used a crayon if the problem were more serious.)

✨ Grateful for understanding neighbors.
